# IllnessRecognition
Study project to get into machine learning world and going further with deep learning
*Note that the majority of work will be formatted in a notebook format to promote comprehension and and enhance portability*

## Folder structure
* **/bootstrap**
    * Introduction project to get started with ML
* **/app**
    * /ml
        * First part of the project, mainly focusing on Machine Learning solution to really understand data processing
    * /dl
        * Second part of the project, going for Deep Learning solution and start creating neuronal networks
